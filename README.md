# SA Studytools

Even if you've been using AWS for a while, it is a good idea to prepare before going in for the solutions architect exam.

This repo contains a study guide and a quiz app to test your knowledge.

The study guide is in yaml format, which makes it human and machine readable. You can use it to study even without the quiz app.

The quiz app is written in python and runs in the terminal. It takes you through descriptions and uses cases of each service, and if there are sub-topics of that service, descriptions and uses cases of its sub-topics as well. The app doesn't keep track of your score or how many questions you've answered, just keep hitting enter to advance through each section. The prompt will return when it is done.
